Hi!
Please only edit within this folder unless explicitly told otherwise by ESTHER:

java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode

This is because the FTC DriverHub is an app and this project has the code for the entire app, 
so if you edit anything else, there's a high chance of it breaking :D

If you want a sample op-mode or auton, copy one from this folder:

java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller

(into above specified, allowed to edit, teamcode folder)

If you want more info on op-modes, auton, or team code, look here:

java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/readme.md

Any other questions?

Ask ESTHER! (or the internet, but if it has to do with can you editing a file, 
please ask ESTHER, cuz breaking things is BAD)

If it's complicated, she likely won't know (she's still learing ya'know, just like you), 
but she has cool and experienced coding friends and will get you an answer!

(probably)

Thanks for reading!
