Hi!

Unless explicitly told otherwise by ESTHER, please only edit inside this folder:

java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode

This is because the FTC DriverHub is an app and this project has the code for the entire app, 
so if you edit anything else, there's a high chance of it breaking :D

If you want a sample op-mode or auton, copy one from this folder:

java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller

(into above specified, allowed to edit, teamcode folder)

If you want more info on op-modes, auton, or team code, look here:

java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/readme.md

If you want to tinker around with a working code, made by yourself or another team member, 
please duplicate it, that way you can safely work on it without distrupting the working code.
Remember, we always want at least one working code for competitions and drive tests.

Any other questions?

Ask ESTHER! (or the internet, but if it has to do with editing a file, 
please ask ESTHER, cuz breaking things is BAD)

If it's complicated, she likely won't know (she's still learing ya'know, just like you), 
but she has cool and experienced coding friends and will get you an answer!

(probably)

Finally, remember that robotics is moving "From frustration to frustraion," as Mr. Ward would say.
So don't worry if things don't work. That's part of the process, and no one and nothing is perfect.
But you'll get better, and things that were hard will be easy, and things that felt impossible 
will feel... slightly less impossible. 

Remember, the learning along the way is just as important as the end goal.

Thanks for reading!

Now get out there and code!
